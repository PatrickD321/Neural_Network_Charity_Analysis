# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Overview 
The dataset from Alphabet Soup shows organizations that have received funding for various projects over the years. We will attempt to use a Neural Network Model to predict how successful, or if the funding was put to meaningful use by the various organization. This analysis should be able to determine if Alphabet Soup will be continued with its program or make major changes to the existing format.

Looking at the dataframe that was downloaded from “charity_data.csv”, the question that was asked in the Project Overview, the outcome of the   charity work, “IS_SUCCESSFUL” column is considered our target for the model.
